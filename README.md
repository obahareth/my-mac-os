## Applications

I'm slowly transitioning to cross-platform software because I want to be able to use the majority of my apps on any OS.

### Productivity

#### [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) - Launcher

- Raycast is both my launcher and entry point to lots of [awesome extensions](https://wiki.omar.engineer/apps-and-tools/raycast/extensions).
- It has a great community and [amazing extension store](https://www.raycast.com/store) that you can use.
- It's extremely easy to develop extensions for.
- I also made some [extensions](https://www.raycast.com/obahareth) and [scripts](https://github.com/obahareth/raycast-scripts) for it.

Here's a small example of me using it to quickly [run/evaluate Ruby](https://www.raycast.com/obahareth/ruby-evaluate) code:

![](https://i.imgur.com/L2KIaO7.gif)

#### [Paste](https://pasteapp.io) - Clipboard History

- Paste is a clipboard manager that can sync your clipboard history with your iOS devices.
- Available on Setapp (see below)

#### [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/) - All my Tasks in One Place

- TickTick helps me plan out everything I want to do either for the short term or long term (I'm not sure if I follow GTD)
- Tasks, habits (e.g. drink x liters of water), calendar, and reminders all in one app
- The one place I go to to answer the question "What do I have to do today?"
- Has apps on all platforms I use, and a great web app
- Really powerful calendar integration (works just like a standard calendar app) with quick links to join meetings
- It also has global quick add with a hotkey. Together with lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more

#### [1Password](https://1password.com) - Password manager

- Generate all of my passwords with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by a master password and two factor authentication.
- No longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website that I am signed up on whilst [activating two factor authentication](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) wherever possible.

#### [MindNode](https://mindnode.com) - Interactive Mind Mapping

- I write A LOT, too much actually, MindNode helps me write short summaries of my thoughts that I "connect the dots" (or lines) between.

#### [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) - Control incoming/outgoing network traffic

- Amazing networking tool that gives you a clear picture of what connections are incoming to your computer and what are outgoing.
- Takes a bit of time to set it up correctly and is quite an insightful experience first turning it on and having it notify every couple of seconds that some app is trying to send data to some server and whether you want to allow that.
- This is essential if you want to take control of what information gets sent out from your computer and what connections have right to connect to your data.

### Code

#### [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) - Code editor

- My favorite editor that I use to write code in. I use [many extensions](https://wiki.omar.engineer/apps-and-tools/visual-studio-code/extensions) for it.
